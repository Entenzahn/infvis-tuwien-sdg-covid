    <h2>ToDo</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Add our hypothesis explanations</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
    <p>Newspapers describe the major difficulties of the Indian country to deal with the global crisis. Brookings Institution points out India as the top one country where extreme poverty is likely to increase the most with the current health crises. We study the Indian population, by looking into the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Index Scores designed by the United Nations. They give us information on Indian states situation with regard to several domains. We focus on the test and vaccination campaigns, and their development per state inside different groups of people and over time for studying the Covid-19 outbreak The SDG India Index data was provided by the Aayog National Institution for Transforming India and the Covid-19 data was found in Kaggle, in one users dataset processed with data from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and covid19india.org website that uses the most recent numbers provided in state bulletins. We wanted to find out if there might be a correlation between how Indian states score, is it good or bad for one SDG indicator and how it is able to manage the health crisis over time. We thought that the initial poverty of one state could have an influence. With this tool one can play to find out and generate other hypotheses.</p>
    <h2>Preprocessing</h2>
    <p>Data was preprocessed using the pandas framework and is done dynamically by joining our various data-tables across a custom-made ID-table that maps our various dataframe entries to the state's ID name for backend processing. Since the tool handles null-values we are using the entire data-frame, only filtering out some indicators for presentation. Generally it should work with all SDG indicators, except #14 for which there is limited data and which has therefore been removed from the dataset entirely.</p>
    <h2>Development</h2>
    <p>Two ideas for analysis perhaps: predicting full vaccination saturation or something akin to chi-square computation to filter out the SDG factors on which covid performance (such as vaccination rate) is most dependent.</p>
